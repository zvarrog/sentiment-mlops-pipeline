ruby dawson is death personified well she is a grim reaper who is on probation fate has given ruby the chance to delay judgment of her soul and redeem herself by working as a reaper the last place she wants to be is on a boat but that is exactly where she finds herself when she is given an assignment on a luxury caribbean cruise she is distracted by jack deverell who seems to see right through her charm to the woman she is inside when several unscheduled unexplained deaths happen fate wants to know who and ruby needs to find the culprit unfortunately jack is the prime suspect my biggest complaint about this story is how much sex was in the story it wasn t balanced out with the rest of the story i felt like the whole book was just about sex with a side of story this happens because of jack s nature being bound to a demon who feeds on sexual energy but it felt like it was sex sex sex the entire book it was too much i don t feel like we were along for the ride to help solve the mystery of who and why all these murders were happening the way they investigated was to go to clubs and feel the energy around them so there was a lot of them sitting there watching people getting freaky on the dance floor waiting for that feeling it was boring i was very disappointed because the first in this series was stellar this one just fell flat for me i did enjoy getting to know ruby and finding out why she was condemned to be a reaper i felt like jack and ruby were a good match for each other but i got sick of all the sex it was took over the book drowning out the actual story would i recommend this story mehwould i read it again nowould i read this author again yesthe grave seriesgrave intentions the grave series book grave destinationsgrave vengeance,3,1762,342,0,-0.0421,1737.0,1.0,,,0,0.0,0,5.152046783625731,3,4
ivy entwined by laura simcoxwritten with humor and a little raunchy on the language side this book was entertaining ivy has good intentions for the town and her life but things don t always go as planned the scene where she s in the kitchen has been on the wrong side of a hammer then the freezer door hits her on the head followed by the coffee grinder spilling all over her is so much real life haven t we all had those kinds of situations where everything seems to go wrong he still sounded like a tool good thing she hadn t marriedhim because by now he d be taking a dirt nap and she d be in prison ivy callahan is the new mayor of celebration she has big plans to revitalize the downtown area of celebration marcus weaver is ready to invest in celebration by bringing big box megamart into town which will help with the huge unemployment rate ivy and marcus both want success for celebration but don t agree with how to get there they do agree that there is considerable chemistry between them and can t seem to keep from thinking about the other or keying their lips and other body part from bumping together the lies and complicated schemes abound and feelings are hurt multiple times both know the other doesn t want their plan to go through yet they are both surprised and hurt when overhearing it flat out why a little depressing with so much anger and hurt and lies i enjoyed the humor in this book i look forward to reading future books by laura simcox i received a copy of this book from the publisher ,3,1515,287,0,-0.0088,,,,,0,0.0,0,5.2787456445993035,3,2

i received this book from the author for an honest review i wish we could also use half stars because i would rate this book stars i started out liking the characters and the quirkiness of amelia tina but than as i got a little more into the book i started to get annoyed with amelia felt like she was self centered and selfish who stands someone up and doesn t really even give it a thought or doesn t think to text them to cancel or reschedule she also didn t even act like she had done anything wrong when her best friend tina called her on it this lead to them not speaking for several weeks and she acted like it was tina s fault not hers the book does get better after we get past the debacle of amelia dating clint and getting her closure with her ex simon i was all about ryan from the beginning and definitely rooted for him once amelia finally took control of her career and love life than that s when she started to redeem herself in my eyes than of course like any good book once the main female leads starts to find her hea the author has to throw in a curveball i was pretty much expecting it and it was pretty well done i had so much respect for how amelia handled it but than i kinda felt like the wrap up and ending was a little rushed i wished there was a little more detail and closure given i hear that there is another book coming with tina as the main character i m really hoping that it s a bit longer and that the ending doesn t feel rushed all in all it s a decent book and a quick read ,3,1512,306,0,0.1398,,,,,0,0.0,0,4.9411764705882355,3,4

this is the heart of stone trilogy the story of tristan stone and nina edwards i will say i purchased the first book crash into me first but after reading many reviews i purchased the box set since you can t know what happens by reading just the first book the first two books end in a cliffhanger while that usually bothers me it didn t in this occasion because i was forewarned and ready with the next book the story started a little off for me because it wasn t too believable however it did get better once i got over that there were too many secrets in the first book that didn t have to wait till the end to be uncovered since this might put some readers off due to the confusion it caused instead of intriguing the reader the books also need a good proofreading to catch the many mistakes in spelling and in print and now that i got the negative out of the way i can tell you about what i did like tristan was just to die for i loved the way he loved nina and how she in turn made him open up nina didn t put up with anything she didn t like and wasn t afraid to say it four years after losing his parents and his twin brother tristan was still dealing with the guilt of the sins of his family all the things his father had done he was now paying for he was beautiful successful and could ha e anything and anyone he wanted yet he wasn t happy and he didn t think he ever could be that is until he meets nina and all that he thought he couldn t have is starting right at him now that he has her he will never willingly let her go but a terrible event threatens to take her away forever which sends tristan s world spiraling into a void will he really lose the only thing that matters in his life nina grew up without a mother and just four years ago lost her father after he was murdered over an investigation he was conducting she s finally working in an art gallery she s happy even when her boss gives her the worst jobs working one night she meets a man that she,3,1973,397,0,0.1897,,,,,0,0.0,0,4.969773299748111,3,4

lots of plot twists here which i normally like somehow they feel under developed resolving before there is enough tension to grab the reader this keeps you from sensing that the characters are in grave peril so the reader doesn t get very invested in the outcome little attention to setting and the dialogue feels jumpy and rushed i like the premise just wish there was more intrigue i decided not to finish it several times but persevered hoping for a more satisfying resolution this is the only book i ve read by this author and i hope they will continue to write with more attention to scene development ,3,607,110,0,0.2057,,,,,0,0.0,0,5.5181818181818185,3,2
without descriptions the book falls flat i have no idea what dr carlton or elizabeth looks like no idea what the baby looked like how can you get yourself into a story with no color it is just blind conversation there was nothing to fuel my imagination to make me want to continue to read this bland story i cannot express my disappointment in the lack of descriptions that would have put life in this book i did complete the book because i think it is unfair to write a review unless you have read the whole thing it was hard but i did it i would suggest having a work critiqued by impartial readers before publishing and maybe this kind of review would not happen ,1,666,127,0,-0.1315,,,,,0,0.0,0,5.244094488188976,1,2
great story what it suffers from is the writing style the author i think is using a free association narrative for the book or he just leaves out a i or we in places where they need to be this makes most of the sentences from the captain s narrative feel like you must have missed something and cause you to go back and reread the sentence also the use of the male title for everyone really leave wondering who is who where this may work in a real navel vessel it really leaves you wondering who these other characters are in a fiction novel i can t get to know who mr garcia is when the captain calls her a him but then the write in the next line refers to o her as a her this really throws off the minor characters and leaves you not caring about them at all like other have said a very fresh story i do love the captain its nice to have one who is not from the james t kirk or honor harrington mold ,3,902,184,0,0.1818,,,,,0,0.0,0,4.9021739130434785,3,2

callie and william were high school sweet hearts until callie s parents end their marriage and her mom whisks them away to las vegas that all happens in the first book which i loved but this one does beat it callie s mom has passed away and now she was back in town to get her sisters situated with their father she has a job and an apartment back home las vegas because she is all grown up now and out on her own the only person that she doesn t want to run into is the one person that she will always love because she did the most despicable thing to him after moving away william can t believe his eyes or the pounding of his heart he wants to hate her he should hate her but she once said if it s meant to be our paths will cross again she had been the dreamer of all things possible but now it didn t seem that she had dreams at all callie needed to resist william at all cost because what he didn t know about her would soon surface and she d have to leave again everything about him edged its way back into her heart so when her husband shows up she can do nothing but promise to leave with him after getting her sisters settled in the broken william reappears as her life unfolds into a controlled abusive mess as if time could erase what would come for her she explains everything to william and how everything is different not because she chose this it s because she had to do what she did to take care of her family when her sister calls her crying from her husband s hotel room she has only one thing to do a little darkness all wrapped up in a heavy romance of what could have been read the story because my review just does not give it justice ,5,1658,332,0,0.0216,,,,,0,0.0,0,4.993975903614458,5,4

perhaps the author is good at writing something but this novel is confused and for the most part a bad rehash of other authors ideas to be fair there it a spark of a descent plot but it is rapidly lost in a confusing mishmash of meaningless details perhaps his writing is beyondmy bounds this is a tortuous novel on its readers is there a way to get your money back from amazon ,2,378,74,0,-0.0175,,,,,0,0.0,0,5.108108108108108,2,1
ade and stella is there ever a more dysfunctional couple first my low rating is not a reflection on grammar or editing but essentially story line and characters basically i didn t like any character in this book i find it hard to enjoy a story where there is pretty much no likeable character that i can root for or relate to kade was very very disturbed he was a jerk not really nice or sweet to stella and extremely self destructive stella had no backbone and couldn t make up her mind on anything this was surprising for an mc character usually the gals especially the ones that were raised with the club background have some common sense spoiler ahead i pretty much wanted to pitch this book when kade was caught with a hooker but no i wanted to see if maybe he could be redeemed in some way or maybe that stella would wise up and find a different path that was healthy for her and her baby i even got excited when she left him for years because i thought she had wised up i felt a little sick that kade had moved onto mel i mean seriously are these women that stupid that was answered with a big fat yes when they get engaged which made no sense and seemed out of character for a man that liked hookers and was still hung up on stella when he overdosed i just rolled my eyes and thought this can t get any worse i was wrong stella who is now a doctor treats him for the overdose and apparently thinks this is totally a man i want to be with and bring into my daughters life granted she put up a small fight but in the end she has not only forgiven his transgressions with booze hookers her old best friend drugs to the point of an od not accidental and emotional abuse but they are together and expecting another bundle of joy because she obviously thought he was a good father figure this book was so unbelievable and i couldn t respect or really even like any of the characters it was a hot mess and not in a good way ,2,1925,377,0,0.0739,747.0,1.0,,,0,0.0,0,5.106100795755968,2,4
