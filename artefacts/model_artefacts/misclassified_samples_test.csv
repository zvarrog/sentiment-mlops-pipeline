at you get a summary on several other books that the author has read their names and other suggested reading plus some of her personal experience thrown in not that the suggestions are not good ones just that as i am finding while i look over all of the books by this author that i own this one too is way overpriced no doubt she put some time and effort into this book but it is not something that is worth when you can get other larger and more detailed volumes off of amazon kindle or through the mail in amazon s book dept i am not going to list the many other amazon books that are available many of which i own instead i am going to go delete this from my own library with a sad heart sad because i just realized one of the few new to me as of this year how to authors i thought was legit is simply giving lengthy book reviews and yes supplying her references so nothing is illegal and charging a pretty penny for the experience,1,934.0,185.0,1.0,0.0932,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.048648648648649,1,2
okay so not only do we first meet the hero while he is reminiscing about his previous night with his paramour but he is thinking about how creative she is in bed she is who i feel is the more focused upon in this book she is who the book opens up on with the hero fondly remembering her adventurous nature in the sack she is who follows the hero around and tells people that they are lovers with the heroine at the same function it is her birthday party happy birthday tiffany the guy you love and who knows you love him is dancing with his lover right in front of you while rumors of their affair spread through your party it s your birthday so you can cry if you want too he had already met the heroine in book one and i was excited to read their book but after reading this one i am sorely disappointed he knew how he felt for the heroine but ignored her for months and slept around with other women that we get to hear about yay sarcasm not to mention that after they have sex for the first time he is still on her thinking about how making love to tiffany was so different than his other lovers why in the world would i like this guy it is literally at the mark of the story they just had sex for the first time and i was so mad that with only a few pages left i had to stop to write this review i felt the love on her side completely but him nope i felt that after avoiding her for months and sleeping with a bunch of other women that her father throwing the marriage in and him acting like it was what he wanted from the start was really him just trying to make the best of the situation he even tells the reader that at least he is attracted to the heroine so he can have sex with her and get something out of this marriage how is this him being in love and fighting the attraction he is disgusting to me and i am so flipping mad with this guy i did not practically like nick in the first book but i would chose him over alex any day of the year i do not understand how this book got more stars than the first i am utterly shocked by that and i only gave the first one stars because of the heroine urgh this book does not get that good of a rating i strongly disliked the hero and the heroine was a doormat to her dad and the hero she just let him humiliate her repeatedly and took him back right away it gives women a bad name to have heroines like this with the book getting stars i am actually disappointed in the females who read and liked this book sorry but that is how i feel i believe that once the hero and heroine meet then that is it i do not want to hear about his other lovers and how good they are in bed i do not want to hear the hero degrade the heroine as a sex object only and i certainly do not want to read about the heroine having a please treat me like crap sign attached to her rear i love brendon in both stories i want his book but am afraid it will crush my vision of him i am secretly hoping that he is not such a man whore but only pretending while with family and friends and that he has a girl across the ocean who he is in love with and that is the reason for his many and frequent departures okay i went back to the story to finish the last pages and have to say that the epilogue was good but very short it did not make up for the rest of the book though,1,3295.0,676.0,0.0,0.0822,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.874260355029586,1,2
wait so the arum aren t all bad and the luxen aren t all good this book definitely throws all of my preconceived notions about the alien presence introduced in jennifer armentrout s lux series out the window and i loved that a lot it gives me so much more to think about as i continue that series with origin that releases in august i knew as i was reading this book that it was going to receive lots of five star ratings those who love to read lots and lots and lots and lots of steamy sex scenes in your books will love this one jen does know how to write steam it is probably good at this time to mention that this book is not young adult like the lux series it takes place in the same world with the same alien presence but this book is absolutely adult in all ways nothing is left to the imagination in these scenes it is all out there so if that is something you d rather not read you probably are going to be a bit disappointed in this book i have to admit that i have struggled a bit to know just how i wanted to rate this book three or four stars it is a fast and entertaining book to read i did like the characters especially hunter and i thought that hunter s big struggle to overcome his innate nature as an arum and his eventual recognition that he could put the needs of another ahead of his own was fascinating there are so many ideas in this book that i want to see developed further either as a continuation of this story in a series or at least through the lux books what is really going on with the luxen and the arum how is the government involved i read this book very quickly and i enjoyed it for the most part as i read but i ultimately could only give it three stars why well this is probably more of a personal taste thing for me so not everyone will feel this way but i prefer for my romances to involve a lot more buildup and a lot less bedroom action there is obviously a ton of chemistry between serena and hunter a ton hunter can t stop thinking about getting serena undressed from the moment he meets her to be fair his race of arum are almost entirely focused on want and need if they want something or need something they just take it simple as that hunter wants serena hunter is going to take serena his inner thoughts simply illustrate this tendency but i felt like this story was all about hunter pushing past his natural tendencies and becoming a little more human in his relationship with serena that does happen it does but let s be honest these two end up humping like rabbits for most of this story all the time and frankly i got bored with it after the tenth scene or so take out the sex scenes and this page book is more like pages of actual story the story was pretty interesting serena witnesses a lux murdering her friend who has witnessed two lux turning into their true forms while speaking about some project that seems dubious now the government asks hunter to protect her it turns out that the government might not be so benevolent the luxen are involved in higher levels of government and might be manipulating things for an evil purpose serena is being protected by an alien species that isn t known for their kindness and altruistic tendencies hunter and serena find themselves falling in love despite their obvious differences all of this was super interesting but of the book simply focused on their intense physical attraction it would have been a better book if more time had been focused on personalities and serena s struggle to come to terms with her new world view why do these two people fall in love despite all the reasons they shouldn t what draws them to one another using this book as a guide it would seem as if most of the draw is purely physical and for me at least this didn t fly i wanted a bit more so take this review for what it is i recognize that this is the sort of review that automatically gets voted as unhelpful on sites like amazon because i haven t jumped on the five star bandwagon with this one i do see that many will love it because jen truly is an entertaining writer and this is an entertaining book i do want to know more about hunter and serena s future and hopefully they ll show up in the lux books daemon makes an un named appearance in this one but i think i prefer this story being told through the young adult prism as it was in the lux series three stars,3,4354.0,839.0,0.0,0.1948,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.189511323003575,3,4
good story it jumped around sometimes and that left me feeling confused but most of the issues were cleared up throughout the book i did have trouble suspending reality enough to embrace the fact that rafael is only yet is a world renowned conductor his other business interests i could believe realistically but just not the conductor but who knows maybe it s possible goodness knows i can t carry a tune in a bucket so i know nothing about the background workings of orchestras i hope we ll get to know more about some of the other characters in this story especially hawk and dani theirs would be a good story to read,3,620.0,114.0,0.0,0.1192,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.43859649122807,3,2

what it boils down to for me aidan got off too easy and was oh so clueless i realize that he still experienced pain from lily s death he felt he let her down and was responsible for her death but geez how could he not see that cora was in love with him when the realization hit and he finally saw what was so obvious to others well i wanted to go all tangled on his a i liked cora and understood her fears but i just wished she would ve spilled her guts to aidan sooner sometimes a guy needs a good hammer to the head to get the picture and i know for a fact that cora could wield that hammer with ease loved getting more presley and dimitri scenes they are so natural together and know how to set the pages on fire and at the end wham bam total commitment i really wanted to see their dungeon play as they furthered their relationship big time ella s character is obviously getting the build up for the next installment in the series not sure how cool that will be since she works for aidan but i m excited because it looks like she ll be paired with kyler does this mean that kenzie will be paired with porter or with sawyer hmm i like it when they keep you guessing,3,1168.0,234.0,0.0,0.2084,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.9914529914529915,3,4

unhallowed ground is a short study roughly pages in gothic fiction following the tradition it includes the dilapidated estate a reclusive relation a haunting past and a doomed future with an emphasis on setting to create emotion and in truth a character i m a big fan of the gothic novel and after giving this some thought i figured out what wasn t clicking all the bare bones of the story are there and with some tweaking could turn this into a great book it comes down to pacing and timing even in short stories gothic tales seem to take their time building on the atmosphere and emotion of the story the suspense is coupled with the gloom and doom here the plot is too rushed and needs more development even with the restraints of a short page length this can be accomplished the relationship with clemency is absurdly hurried and the engagement or coming about of it is too fast since tension switches to focus on their life and love together this moment in time needs to be further developed and slowed down perhaps some internal dialogue or secret past exposed would assist in building a reader attachment and investment to the characters specifically clem i really did not understand her motives behind her decisions if this were solely based on her thoughts or provoked by the haunting bride curse her own insecurities would indeed help henry s anger is a little confusing as well i understand the tight sibling bond but it hints at something more sinister that hint never goes anywhere and if the reader is to draw their own conclusion they might need a little more leading down the correct path of assumption rating,2,1625.0,288.0,0.0,0.0055,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.642361111111111,2,1

this is a pretty good basic pi mystery the narrator frank mango is a fat guy we know this because he is constantly commenting on the volumes he eats i e pound meatloaf and the fact that he is fat mango is hired to find a lost young woman who in description seems to jive with the dead bodies that have shown up dumped in hollywood this leads him into drug and sex sorry no rock and roll the mystery is actually pretty good my problem is the that the dressing detracts from the book the author wants frank to be a pain in everyone s butt so out of no where frank will suddenly become obstreperous many times it is incongruous he will be having a very productive conversation with someone and suddenly decide it is time to be a royal pain it would not make sense except to fulfill his image of himself as a tough guy pain there is some crudity in the book if oral sex and frequent references to the like are not to your taste skip this book if you find humor in it then its fine the references fit the character and the plot line much of which takes place in the porn film industry all in all a pretty entertaining though bit crude pi mystery,3,1140.0,223.0,0.0,0.1354,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.112107623318385,3,2
author jessica scott has a flare for putting her readers right in the middle of army life whether it be in the middle of a firefight or on base dealing with the aftermath sergeant first class reza iaconelli s life is the army preparing his men and women for what s ahead shipping out with them and leading them through the sand his only problem with deployments though withdrawal reza is an alcoholic but after being grounded and confronted by his superior either sober up for good or be discharged reza decides to give up the booze because without the army what does he have easier said then done especially when everything and everyone around him is going to hell in a hand basket half of his troop is suffering from ptsd but they can t get the care they need and deserve because the base clinic is too overwhelmed but when reza goes to confront to situation he runs into the spitfire psychiatrist captain emily lindberg not only does she test his patience and good intentions but she also tests his beliefs the strength of his demons and his commitment he s failed everyone around him though and he won t let her name be added to that list no matter how tempting it is to open up to her and allow her closer all for you is not a light story it deals with the affects of war on our servicemen battling alcoholism and parental abuse and coming face to face with your failings despite giving something your all the story dives head first into the mental health issues facing our servicemen which is a real issue that is not only incredibly sad but disappointing that our country can fail at something so important it s a heart wrenching story while i enjoyed that aspect of the book and thought it was masterfully written i did feel like it overshadowed the romance happening between reza and emily the intensity that reza showed in previous books and i thought for sure would be front and center when it came to love seemed be to lacking there was no denying the chemistry between these two the romance just didn t punch me in the gut like the previous books in this series did however i did like bother characters emily was a commendable character dedicated to her work and possessing a huge heart and while reza was a strong character battling many inner demons the thing i enjoyed most was watching his character grow as the story progressed all for you might not have ended up being my favorite of the series but it was still a good read packed with the emotion that i have come to expect when reading jessica scott s books i received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review,3,2611.0,481.0,0.0,0.1278,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.428274428274428,3,2
