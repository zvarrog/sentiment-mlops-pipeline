i just finished reading the nd book by ms bale and i cannot tell you how disappointed i was the first book was very good for a new author and i was looking forward to her next book what a mistake after forcing myself to read the nd book which lack any creative writing however i read it because i bought it i could not believe that in the last part of the book when the book finally became somewhat interesting it ends with continued in next book a book is suppose to have a beginning middle and end not a continuation this is not a tv series i think amazon has begun a wonderful thing by letting authors self publish however there are some authors who take advantage of this by not finishing this nd book which would have made it a series ms bale takes advantage of the readers who did like the book by making them wait and buy her next book i truly think this is disgraceful and greedy making the reader have to buy the next book if they want to find out how the nd book ends which i truly believe she will have a continuation at the end of the rd book too some of my favorite authors victoria alexander the effingtons julia quinn the bridgertons hannah howell the murrays all were long series however each and every one of the books had a beginning middle and end by making each book a truly rewarding story the reader was pleased to purchase the next book in ms alexander s case the effingtons had books which even more books that connected to these i read all of the effington books and loved them as julia quinn s the bridgertons and hannah howell s the murrays because each and every one of the books were fantastic ms bale i think you should reconsider how you want to publish your books either you are an author and can finish each and every book or stop writing by finishing a book if it is truly a good book the reader becomes interested enough to buy the next book which can be tied into the previous book or they will go on to another author i am truly not trying to be mean but i have read over historical romance books and my favorites are scottish and regency i will not buy your next book as far as i am concerned your nd book ended with to be continued ,1,2235,415,0,0.1927,,,,,0,0.029977628635346757,0,5.385542168674699,1,5
the author may have had a good general outline of a story but the character development was nonexistent seriously i hated all of the characters even the ones i think i was supposed to like then i realize this tiny book is just part of a very large series sorry i won t be reading anymore it was way to confusing with too many plot lines and characters to keep track of sorry i usually like to give new authors a chance but this just wasn t good ,1,454,88,0,-0.0071,,,,,0,0.024229074889867842,0,5.159090909090909,1,2
three books of the same story over and over again jack is a man whore but she s no better got tired of the love triangle of the same people in all three books and really a something woman not protecting herself from pregnancy while sleeping with two men within days of each other when she was supposedly madly in love with only one of them for these characters to all be well educated and top in their field of employment i never came across more selfish behavior and they never seemed to learn from their experiences lack of communication among the two love interests got boorish and tiresome the characters showed no growth and the story supposedly happened over many years misery loves company and all characters were miserable yet did nothing to improve the issue sorry i wasted by time ,1,812,137,0,-0.0153,,,,,0,0.013546798029556651,0,5.927007299270073,1,2

i ve read the same plot several times female thief inevitably caught by alpha male who magnanimously offers to set her free and or not press charges if the heroine will consent to whore herself out for an agreed upon number of days six times in the last four years and while i m a realist who understands there are very few new ideas in regards to both movies and books and not claiming to have any myself but i m also not passing myself off as an author i do expect new twists on old ideas or hell even old ideas done again very well but this is just more category dreck which is a shame because i ve quite liked ms kane s work in the past especially her erotic romance and maybe that s my problem i went in expecting a sexy category romance and instead just got less hot erotic romance disguised as category but the difference at least for me is that her erotica isn t category and doesn t read anythgin like it so maybe it s just me maybe i m having a hard time mixing the two but i don t think so even the sex scenes don t live up to her previous standards give me unapologetic category romance or give me blazing believable erotica romance but don t give me lackluster efforts on both counts and expect a good review historical details were excellent though ,2,1299,229,0,0.1717,,,,,0,0.024634334103156273,0,5.672489082969432,2,3

smooth writing nice story although not very abundant in terms of originality and turns and twists but both the language and the historical facts do not correspond to the regency era just as it happens in most regency books the characters are underdeveloped and it s either the shortness of the novella or the way the story is rushed that made me feel that the author was trying hard to convince me that love bloomed for sure i couldn t figure it out all by myself i also find it hard to believe that the heroine a young woman who is so bright she has after all written a book at age that is the rage amongst the tone could so easily fall for a man with complete disregard for the consequences i am not talking about the consequences at a social level but for her personally it s entirely puerile and it does not go with the brilliant strong minded young woman she is supposed to be if i think of it all characters emotional reactions are driven by the other s physical appearance in this book there s nothing remotely resembling love although the word love is repeated to the point of becoming overused the intimate scenes are quite disappointing but leaving all the above aside this novella is quite pleasant for the romance lover who is just looking for a light read and a happy ending other reviews mention that the author has much better works worth checking it out ,3,1409,247,0,0.2329,,,,,0,0.0099361249112846,0,5.704453441295547,3,4

this short story had all it needs a full story arc fully fleshed out characters and a scene setting to draw you right in from the start to hold you until the final full stop if this is how this author writes i would certainly want to read more by her my gripe with the rest of this book is that it s only teasers excerpts in this book to read the full stories you d have to buy carniepunk paperback caine rachel author jul paperback of which i thought i had an omission on my part because i failed to read the description properly and just downloaded this book on the recommendation of a friend she was right because i loved the story by jennifer estep but had i known the rest was mere excerpts i wouldn t have gotten this one but gone for the full version of carniepunk because the excerpts of the other stories make me think i would love those too ,3,880,165,0,0.1624,,,,,0,0.028409090909090908,0,5.333333333333333,3,5
i have been a fan of rob colton for years and i am very excited that he is finally with a publishing company this first release is good matty is dealing with tough family problems whilst learning a new job and finds himself very drawn to his new boss even though baxter leaves the bar with a girl every saturday matty and his cousin brian are very likable characters and the story did take a couple of unexpected twists the problem for me was that there were a couple of points where i felt a stronger emotional response was needed i don t want to give spoilers but let s just say they were negative situations and i thought they would have a bigger impact on the character still i can t wait for his next offering this review appeared originally at mrs condit friends read books,3,809,145,0,0.1564,,,,,0,0.027194066749072928,0,5.5793103448275865,3,4

that t my best description for this book i really wanted to like it but it was just okay for me i liked all the characters i liked the writing i wanted more mc action we get none in this book our h tripp and our h doll spend most of the book traveling town to town in order to keep doll safe from another outlaw gang most of the book was about their developing romance or lack there of at times not much else happened i believe the information missing in this book about the developing plot will be in the next book the next book is about sass and tank the reviews on that book are not very encouraging i m not sure if i will bother reading that one in the end i really liked tripp and doll i liked how their romance developed i liked the writing i did not like the lack of action finally i felt some issues were presented to the reader and then too quickly resolved the situation surrounding tripp s mom played out very quickly this resolution was told to us in tripp s thoughts that was my other issue the reader is told what happens rather than being shown would i recommend sorry i m on the fence on this one ,3,1168,238,0,0.2497,,,,,0,0.036815068493150686,1,4.907563025210084,3,1
 stars sebastian is a billionaire and i have to say i hate billionaire books i just can t relate but the billionaire aspect played a very small role in the story and i liked it better than i otherwise might have because of it sebastian makes his money designing mobile apps he s on the verge of releasing a gay dating app and to promote the app has agreed to appear on a gay reality show along the lines of the bachelor it requires him to be cut off from the real world during taping so he turns the app over to liam his personal assistant to push the app over the finish line liam has worked for sebastian for years and is honored and distressed by the additional work because one wrong move could doom the app not only that liam has had a serious crush on his boss for a long time so the idea of a dating reality show doesn t make him feel warm and cuddly inside but liam works through it becoming sebastian s only contact with the outside world for a short time every day to discuss the app liam is realistically written running around at work trying to keep the app release on time and helping sebastian keep his sanity he keeps his crush a secret not disclosing it to anyone which would be inappropriate considering his and sebastian s work relationship i also appreciated the realism of the show and the crew i had niggles though adding to the group of men one of sebastian s employees was in bad taste and had lawsuit written all over it i also couldn t believe both sebastian and liam believed wholeheartedly that sebastian would really find true over on a reality show it was a marketing ploy nothing else i ve thought a few times after reading this that it may have worked better from liam s pov only we get into sebastian s head but it doesn t add all that much to the story sebastian is focused mainly on the show and we learn precious little about him or what he thinks but his thoughts about the other men are entertaining and i remained curious about who the final two would be nonetheless sebastian s about face when he realizes he feels something for liam came out of the blue and while the resolution of that was cute the resulting sexual encounter felt out of place under the circumstances overall though i enjoyed the book though liam and sebastian and the supporting characters were likable and the story interesting and different ,3,2468,422,0,0.115,,,,,0,0.02025931928687196,0,5.848341232227488,3,1

aimed squarely at seven and eight year old readers with a nine year old heroine this book has a lot of fun with spy action hero conventions and adds a bit of geography and art appreciation just to sweeten the mix the subtitle is cool adventure book for kids and that pretty fairly sums it up the author wisely does not over reach the plot is clear and straightforward a disappointed artist is stealing masterpieces and replacing them with his own terrible versions of the originals there aren t a lot of characters the mite family and a few other helpful spies there aren t too many gadgets and the best weapon is natural yogurt the story isn t set up to be zany or frantic or so cleverly over the top that it just becomes silly and precious rather dynah finds out she s from a spy family and is sent out on her first mission she is a pleasant and bright kid and has not been saddled with any colorful but distracting quirks there is a lot of mild humor and some funny good natured observations about parents dynah s mother sends her on her first mission with a toothbrush and toothpaste and clean socks there is some mild danger a lot of action and excitement and a tidy finish there are no awkward developments or odd bits where you wonder why the author went where he went it s all fun and light and cheerful i think the secret to these very early reader action books is to keep the readers involved and interested but not to overload them with manic over writing it s a hard line to walk not too cartoony but also not so hip or ironic or full of inside jokes that the reader doesn t really get it and jay bright walks that line well the book is tightly written vocabulary is varied but age appropriate the narrative is direct and easy to follow but it s not all just short direct present tense sentences a kid can read and understand and enjoy this story and feel at the end that he she has read a real book so not to over analyze this is fun good humored and a very solid action tale for a new reader please note that i found this book while browsing amazon kindle freebies i have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book ,4,2214,396,1,0.2177,,,,,0,0.015808491418247517,0,5.590909090909091,4,1

when i think about the typical rock star novel i think alcoholic rocker who s a huge butt completely domineering and treats his love interest like crap until she finally manages to change him not that this story didn t have some of that but the rock star wasn t that big of a butt and the girl wasn t as much of a sniveling groupie holliday was independent sarcastic and knew how to hold her own against him she didn t follow him all over on his tours she had her own thing going on and stayed true to herself dalton jack johnny outlaw whatever you want to call him wasn t an alcoholic or drug addict he was over that stage by the time they met apparently he made an effort to make time for holliday and i didn t read about all the groupies vying for his attention that i typically read about in rock star novels no over the top crazy ex s trying to destroy him or holliday no unnecessary splits note i said unnecessary and he seemed genuine i adored his love for holliday their relationship started fast but i enjoyed it and their relationship was believable a few things bothered me that kept me from handing out that extra star to make it as much as i love the steamy scenes this author is very good with them by the way there were too many and it almost took away from the story my other complaint dalton s perspective was only thrown in times and i don t know why it wasn t added more often i wanted inside his head more everything else about the story i loved for the price it was more than worth the read ,4,1559,283,0,0.1663,,,,,0,0.021167415009621552,0,5.508833922261484,4,2
