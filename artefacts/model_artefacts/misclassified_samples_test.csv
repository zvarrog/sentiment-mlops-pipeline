this is the fifth book in a serial romance you must read the others first to be able to understand what s going on in this one you can see my reviews of the previous books throbbing hearts reaching hearts crushing hearts and tempting hearts i am still head over heels for this series it has never stalled and only continues to impress as being suspenseful erotic and romantic it s much like the classic soap operas of yesteryear but without the overacting the book picks up with tommy and rebecca s liaison it s now known that he s a very bad man but he continues to unleash new levels of evil rebecca is still a bit disturbing seeing what a scorn woman will doannie and brendan seem to be going along swimmingly they re enjoying each other he s completely opening up to her and feeling things he didn t even have with his college girlfriend for the first time in years and perhaps ever he wants and can imagine a future with someone christiano makes a small appearance in this book i can t figure out where he still fits in while in the peripheral to the main plot his character still possesses the ability to turn things upside down one last morsel there is a return of a character from throbbing hearts who changes the game just when i thought the elusive realization confrontation between annie and brendon was going to happen it didn t crisis adverted but then it did happen maybe i m a glutton for punishment or perhaps more aptly i wanted it to transpire because we all know it will now it s like ripping the band aid off let the drama from her identity concealment occur so they can move on the unfortunate part is this one ends without a resolution to the scene perhaps even more unnerving to me is the sentence in the author s note where it states the next and sixth installment will be the final in this series i can t even wrap my head around how eve,5,2803.0,538.0,10.0,8.5,1496.6666666666667,3.0,,,0,0.0,0,5.2897727272727275,5,4

william shakespeare s brother john shakespeare is an intelligencer for the queen somewhat like a cia agent of today while trying to find a missing girl as a favor to a condemned priest he starts to find indications of a plot which could be an assassination attempt against queen elizabeth i an invasion by spain or an attempt to wreck the intelligencer spy system his investigations take him to all parts of england to question various religious factions catholic jesuit puritan etc and to the queen s court itself the story is certainly interesting as one can garner a good deal of knowledge of elizabethan times and the religious persecutions and beliefs that were prevalent i was glad to see that william shakespeare made a few appearances in this story while i didn t think anything about the dialogue between most characters being in modern day vernacular it seemed a bit strange that william spoke the same rather than using didst thou wouldst thine etc i guess i am too used to his writings i certainly did get involved in the story and near the end found it hard to put down as things really started to get intense for me it proved to be an educational and enjoyable novel,5,1780.0,325.0,10.0,11.5,1948.0,1.0,187.0,1.0,0,0.0,0,5.619047619047619,5,4

chasedyanna is so out of her league in this one with constantijin from the start he was open with what he wanted and she didn t know what to do with it this was just so short he didn t really chase her though even in the times that he came after her it was more like he was trying to figure her out if she was up to games or not she didn t have a clue what to do though but i liked how she was holding off and not just falling into his bed this was good and i can t wait to read more courtedthese just keep getting better i understand yanna wants to put off letting everyone know about them she has way more to lose then he does plus he already let her know what to expect for him to catch an attitude was selfish i thought he would pull back when he found out her sexual status but of course he didn t he s willing to take something he can t give back and possibly cause her to suffer through the back talk and jabs of her co workers for nothing in return i don t think she should ve chased after him though he knew what he was doing it was the same thing he did before again this is getting better and better cagedin the little bit said about drake i really was starting to like him she cried so much in this one i just wanted her to shut up the mess he told arian was so out of the way i thought he d finally had enough of her or at the very least he would pull back some from her to get his mind right to force her to continue living there was such a waste if he was going to turn right back around and come to terms with what he was feeling i think the truth should ve been told when he d been in the dog house for longer and he d thought she d leave that would ve been better timing and easier for her to come back because of it when fangirls liesaffi was hilarious in this i was laughing at every silly thing she did to get what she wanted i wasn t interested in the beginning because i thought it was just about women doing whatever backstage and once i caught on it was ,5,2978.5,632.5,10.0,10.0,517.8571428571429,49.0,668.0,1.0,0,0.0,0,4.768674698795181,5,4
blaze of glory prospect springs shifters short read pretty easy to follow along once you realize it takes place in the future but reads like the past wild west days it doesn t give much detail about what happened in the past or the relationships or families pike s peak league of the unnatural this story didn t give much besides the basics the pace of the book made it hard to connect or understand the characters feelings the entire thing could ve been a prologue to something more some can only hold your attention for short stories and this seems to be one of them tipping the scales stop dragon my heart around i love dragon stories this one was great it was way too short but good none the less warriors of darknessgood read kind of confusing to keep up with all that s going on but once you get the names and people straight its an easy follow i d love to hear what happens next and see what they all get into in future books,5,1408.0,278.5,10.0,11.5,517.8571428571429,49.0,190.33333333333334,6.0,0,0.0,0,5.206703910614525,5,4
i was given a free copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review this is one of those books that is in a word perfect the blurb for zenith grabbed my attention but the novel itself sucked me in fairly quickly and didn t let me go until the end there are several main characters in this book and the point of view changes quite a few times throughout the story but its all woven together extremely well and the changing perspectives actually worked in the book s favor i think zenith starts out by introducing us to several characters that are essential to the rest of the book martin charles trevor and jennifer other main characters are introduced a little later including edward and his sister stella my opinions of the characters changed a few times throughout the storyline and i was pleasantly surprised by this i love books and characters that evolve as time goes on this is first and foremost a science fiction book set in the future while there is romance both m f and m m that aspect of the book takes a back seat to the overall story and what s happening to the zenith and her crew while i love a good romance i have to admit that i think the book worked better without it being the focus my attention was caught and held by the story itself and the amazing job the author did with the writing zenith ends perfectly set up to go into the next book which makes me both happy and aggravated at the same time because i can t seem to get past the overwhelming desire to know what happens next my only complaint is that i now have to wait an undetermined amount of time for the sequel i could cry over that fact i really could ,5,2486.5,485.5,10.0,11.5,1179.5,2.0,1408.0,3.0,0,0.0,0,5.208201892744479,5,4

 starsreviewed by tracey lou parker for kindle friends foreverwhen we came to the end of book one raising ryan i think we all went into shock mode as a straight forward love story it was not to be the story of luke and reese continues months later in the follow up resisting ryan reese has no idea where luke is and tries in vain to carry on with her life she befriends her next door neighbour sean who has a bit of a soft spot for her ok he fancies the pants off her book two stays in the present day which i m glad to say works really well reese is reunited with her father and slowly lets him into her life because he has changed his life around he regrets the way he has treated his wife and daughter and by doing this he hopes to atone for his past sins luke s father has been released from prison and sets about recruiting his son by threatening the safety of reese he has no choice but to join his father and his associates in the dealing of drugs and guns book two definitely redeemed itself in my eyes and although i felt book one was slow and a tad boring and predictable i loved the cliffy however resisting ryan is fast paced and action packed and i have to admit that i loved the gritty story line with a brilliant plot to match more characters have been introduced which has made this story so much more exciting too once again we are left on tenterhooks will luke make it back to reese will they have their happy ever after will his dad leave him alone to live the life he wants with reese don t be put off by me mentioning to you that the beginning of book one starts off a little unhurriedly because this certainly is not the case in this one and it really looks like we re going to be in for humdinger of an ending i m going to keep my eye on this author and i just can t wait for her new release well done alyssa rae taylor roll on book ,5,2794.0,568.0,11.5,11.5,1777.3333333333333,6.0,658.4,5.0,0,0.0,0,4.989247311827957,5,4

well then i see what all the fuss is about i don t like young virginal heroines because they re often portrayed in a very immature childish way and their dialogues just make them worse the exact opposite was the case here the way she spoke the way she carried herself she wasn t a timid flaky female and i loved that about her yes she had baggage but her character didn t use it at every opportunity to shy away from everyone she kept a mysteriousness about her without coming off as pathetic and wow sebastian he made a big good first impression in the foreword for a then seventeen year old he seemed mature beyond his years if he was cute then he was devastating as an adult all raw passion intense and mysterious it took a while for the seal part to come to the fore and i m quite pleased that there was a little more emphasis on the fact he was military instead of some pampered billionaire who thinks money can buy everything and everyone there were times i thought he recognized talia and then he d say or do something that said he didn t that push and pull is just a part of the magic between this pairing throw in a bit of bdsm lite and the sex fizzled my kindle i m not going to lie i m a bit peeved that this story ended unlike the others without a hea this is part of a serial and now the wait begins this was a very well written beautiful story and i can t wait to read the sequel i read this as a part of the hot alpha seals romance megaset ,5,2192.5,446.5,11.5,10.0,1954.125,8.0,324.5,10.0,0,0.0,0,5.0,5,4

see full review the indigo quilli received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review okay so my review for this is going to be a little different since this is the first volume of a series of novellas oh my lanta i am really anxious for the next novella nikki rae s writing style is smooth and consistent while her story development is rich in content the donor begins with casey an year old who works to make ends meet for herself and her family a co worker tells her about this website called mytruematch com granted we assume what this site is used for but as the story unfolds we get a better glimpse into what this website is really about thus rae sets quite the mystery into motion and leaves you nothing short of wanting more so far i ve been captured in these first pages i wish i could write more but it was over before i knew it and the reader is left on a bit of a cliffhanger it s going to be difficult waiting for the next installment ,5,1448.5,293.5,10.0,10.0,1923.6666666666667,3.0,1102.75,4.0,0,0.0,0,5.074074074074074,5,4
do you know what i love nearly as much as a story that includes the second chance at love theme a man with a british accent this book had both those things and so much more kat and her daughter abbey like the road have moved back home after losing her husband it s been four years and kat has found a balance between staying lost in her past and moving forward she s had the support of her friends and family that broke alongside her and a little girl that lost her father and desperately needed her mother so kat lived not so much in the sense of grabbing life by the horns but she got out of bed each day adrian graves is the gravelly voice behind the theme song to the kids show that abbey can t get enough of so when he gets a random email asking him to perform for a room full of kids he agrees kat wasn t sure what to expect when adrian walked through the doors of the library guitar case in hand but it certainly wasn t the drunk mess of tattoos standing before her you are drunk and you he popped two of the curiously strong mints into his mouth are beautiful jesus christ i ll sober up soon and hopefully you will still be beautiful after he performs fully engaging a room full of kids their afternoon soon turns into dinner and one of the most awkward first kisses of all time for the first time since her husband pete passed away kat is ready to let a man in but both harbor secrets about their past adrian musical background is filled with mistakes that took away both a wife and daughter friends that were like brothers and eventually he just faded into the background but kat is in for the shock of a lifetime when she spots the similarities between him and a certain rock star even as adrian let s her in enough to show to expose the scars of his past and the typical lifestyle of sex drugs rock n roll she is,5,2746.0,547.0,10.0,11.5,1405.1666666666667,36.0,1883.0,1.0,0,0.0,0,5.094972067039106,5,4
aleatha romig gives us a special treat in this expanded version of what she originally thought would be a simple companion novel instead we see the events play out through the eyes of all the men in claire s life tony harry john brent and phil they all get a voice when i read the third book in this series there was a a huge gap of information that i was dying to know about i wanted to know how tony survived while in prison being away from claire nichol and how he came to the conclusions he came to by the time he was released but beyond just tony s revelations we got the insight into the others phil i has skeptical of him early on but his caring for claire and nichol in this put me at ease and actually made me appreciate him far more than i expected brent can you say rock a hard place getting to see brent struggle with the two sides of tony and his feelings of loyalty and friendship towards the man harry now i was not a fan of harry not really at all but i felt horrible for him through most of this he was in difficult spots with every woman he ever loved and dealing with that on top of the way he had to let go of his life for his job made me actually change my tune by the final chapter of this book i was ready to start asking for a harry book john my thoughts on john are really skewed by his c of a wife emily jesus did i want to punch her in her face over and over and over again john dealt with her much better than i would have i think i would have smothered her in her sleep for me john s pov was more of a window into emily rather than john but you saw how he did care for claire as a protector being the one in her life when she lost her parents and i think he balanced emily out enough to ensure that claire and tony could eventually get her to forgive him for the past tony what an emotional mess this man made me i was so choked up during most of his parts in this and then completely lost it towards the end the change he made ,5,2945.5,616.0,10.0,10.0,1405.1666666666667,36.0,346.375,8.0,0,0.0,0,4.844059405940594,5,4

the third book of this series pushed the rating up to stars for me the first book was the usual obscenely young tortured soul rich man playing the field because no woman understands him then he met the heroine and she is kind of different so he will at least go steady with her for a while blah blah blah then towards the end of the second book the element of danger and suspense perked up my interest by the third book tristan and nina were firmly moving up in my estimation the third book picked up the intrigue pace am happy they got their hea even though it was touch and go there for a moment the sex became monotonous at a point though so i started skipping that this trilogy is a good bargain also since i bought the pack for like it is a good series to sink your teeth into nice read ,5,1198.0,245.5,10.0,11.5,698.1304347826087,23.0,398.72222222222223,18.0,0,0.0,0,5.044585987261146,5,4

the book is well written in a sense that regardless if you come from a certain religion you would understand what spirituality means and how it is the same in the universal context you would agree that we all have the same values that we believe and that we hold the same truth we all aim to live with integrity compassion truth and honesty anyone would agree with this spirituality is not something we do spirituality is who we are ,5,659.5,131.5,10.0,10.0,412.125,8.0,593.0,2.0,0,0.0,0,5.345679012345679,5,4

oh where do i start my first piece of advice is not to read this book without reading saturday s at the viper room first that is what happened to me and i was a little confused i went onto amazon and goodreads to try and piece some of the missing puzzle pieces together and that helped a little with all of that being said i took this book by the cover and dove right in so far i am truly enjoying what i ve read of the series after this book i will definitely will be one clicking saturday s at the viper room the runaway viper has caught my attention and it s keeping me on the edge of my seat i keep asking myself that will happen next i personally think this book could be a lot hotter you ve become this beautifully strong woman from a weak manipulated object you re exactly like a phoenix jace describing joely s change after her escape from the viper room jace and joely spent months on the run after her escape from the claws of clara delvine clara doesn t like to lose and loosing joely made her out to seek revenge clara would do anything and everything to get her head viper girl back i found her to be deceiving manipulative and downright cold she didn t care who he hurt in the process she hated that jace took joely from her jace s sole purpose in life was to protect joely from clara joely had a happy life with jace even when they were on the run but they still kept looking over their shoulders they both never knew when clara or her men were going to attack after being on the run clara finally caught up with them and joely had to return to the viper room when she went back that is when she noticed all of the changes it wasn t for the good of the girls clara did it to make a point you cannot leave the viper room jace always tried to be one step ahead of clara but it seemed like she was always two steps ahead of them joely crushed his heart wh,5,2810.5,569.5,10.0,10.0,1596.0,11.0,1785.4285714285713,7.0,0,0.0,0,5.005361930294906,5,4
i have been haunting the virtual shelves of amazon for months hoping this book would magically come out early i lucked out and got to start it a few days early thanks to netgalley the bad news is that meant i tore through it sooner and finished it sooner man i do so love mr abercrombie s writing if you re unfamiliar with the works of joe abercrombie you ll find that they aren t your typical fantasy offering if there is any magic at all it s pretty low key i think the closest thing to magic in this particular book is that the doves crow and eagle used as messenger birds can speak even then they aren t sentient beings holding a conversation they are merely repeating words they memorized what the stories are are very gritty action packed adventures people die and die unpleasantly heroes and villains are tested and not every one of them succeeds friendships are formed out necessity and sealed with sacrifice and blood seldom is there a reward without some terrible cost a few things struck me as a bit different in half a king from what i ve read of mr abercrombie s previous stories one his pov sticks with yarvi through the entire story instead of switching around to different important characters from scene to scene also the tale is confined to one group of people those attached to yarvi instead of switching to battles in different parts of the world it s a much less complex tale in that sense requiring much less work on the part of the read to keep track of details than say one of my favorite of the author s books the heroes lastly this book is intended to be a ya novel that of course reflects the other differences i already mentioned yarvi is about years old and the tale is definitely a coming of age story that being said this is no watered down story with pat resolutions yarvi grows but at great pain and cost death is not pretty or off stage bad decisions are made and they have consequences some folks might ,5,2917.0,553.0,10.0,10.0,1622.6666666666667,3.0,1479.6153846153845,13.0,0,0.0,0,5.3535911602209945,5,4
