a nice little story the rhythm of the verse is good for children for many reasons the story told lacks tension i suspect it would not hold a child s attention even for the length of this one perhaps adding a bit about the girl looking for a toy perfect for her in the same shop,3,282.0,55.0,0.0,0.4354,215.8,5.0,641.0,1.0,0.0,0.017730497,0.0,5.127272727272727,3,4

women serial killer of the th century is a detailed book about sick minded women killing their kin and relatives during the th century the book shows a thorough study of women all over the world using arcenic poisening in my opinion this book is more a listing of sevaral cases of historic poiseners and not really a book that one could read from beginning to end in one sitting from a historic point of view though this is definetely worth having on your digital shelf for looking up facts you could need in study or otherwise,3,533.0,94.0,0.0,0.0482,312.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0075046904,0.0,5.670212765957447,3,1

i have read a little more than half of the book and have come to the conclusion that i cannot suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy this story what follows contains spoilers so proceed with caution for those who do not want to read said spoilers i will get right to my conclusion an interesting premise ruined by poor plot and character development the book starts off with a surprise attack on sydney tehran and beijing by aliens whose only attempt at communication is the enigmatic message never again attempt to develop this kind of technology apparently referring to advanced research being carried out in those three cities what follows is humanity uniting to build a space fleet capable of defending themselves from further attack and to find out just who their attackers are initially three are built one each built by china iran and the eu so far so good it is what happens once these ships are built that is not so good by an extremely unlikely set of circumstances all chinese naval officers senior to the protagonist with the required qualifications to command the chinese ship were at a required training session in beijing during the attack and were all killed the protagonist is a young attractive female lieutenant of the chinese navy apparently her sole qualification is her familiarity with the advanced technology in question acquired during a whole two hours on site as a liaison to the project this it seems is sufficient for the chinese government to place her in command of china s first starship and a full third of the world s entire space fleet instead of rising to the occasion she proceeds to behave like an emotionally immature teenage girl first she makes a headlong attack on an alien ship without making any attempt to determine its identity capabilities or intentions when she is challenged on this by her xo she reacts by ignoring him and proceeding with the attack she is victorious and captures a prisoner an alien fighter pilot determined to be of the race that attacked earth instead of treating the alien like a prisoner of war she befriends it and gives it the run of the ship this is where i stopped reading at this point i would expect a board of inquiry followed by a courts martial to determine the protagonist s punishment never mind remaining in command but i doubt that level of logic will be a part of this story,1,2410.0,409.0,0.0,0.11,580.0,1.0,1942.0,1.0,2.0,0.023651453,0.0,5.89242053789731,1,2

another high quality darkfuse title i must start off by saying that i think that gary fry is a very good writer and as appreciation of any story is subjective no one can expect to connect with everything every writer writes this one just was sort of meh for me high points for creepiness and good writing i thought the changes that were tormenting the main character were quite well done the points off are contained in the spoilers however spoiler alert lt spoiler it must be said that fry is treading very familiar ground with a story of this type pregnant woman feels that something is wrong even sinister with her soon to be born child so comparisons are to be expected this one to make it stand out required a heavier touch than i am used to from fry who is more subtle and traditional see his wonderful novella emergence or even lurker which is darker but still very traditional in style ira levin wrote the definitive story of this type a long time ago and as a recent example tim curran s sow also from darkfuse is similar conceptually but goes for the throat from the outset and leaves you shaking and disturbed lt end spoiler,3,1172.0,200.0,0.0,0.163,664.5,2.0,1289.0,2.0,5.0,0.02986348,0.0,5.86,3,2

as a cornish woman myself now living in the usa i know exactly what cadbury s dairy milk golden syrup lemon curd clotted cream and granulated and caster sugars are but for an american reading this there is going to be some frustration not only are most of the above ingredients hard to find if you do find them over here they are very expensive i have a scale that can be used in both metric and imperial but i realize that once again most americans do not use scales when baking that was one thing that amazed me when we moved over here however saying all that if you go online you can google the measurements and once you have converted the main ones it will be easy to convert the rest ml of double cream is cups so just a little over cups i don t think it is going to affect the recipe if you are not exactly accurate with your measuring g condensed milk is just over ounces which is just under a cup yet again a little over or under is not going to affect the recipe that much there is a good lot of british humor in this book and this woman is a woman after my own heart as she suggests strongly using only real vanilla yee haa only the best so even if you never make these ice creams get the book and be ready to start drooling the recipes are delicious were i writing this review for the english market i would have given it stars but as this has been released over here for the american market i feel that i can only fairly give it stars as for more folks to be able to enjoy it it needs to be converted into imperial us measurements and yes there is a difference in a us gallon pint and a gallon pint elsewhere in the world a us gallon only has fl ozs whereas elsewhere a pint has fl ozs,3,1760.0,338.0,0.0,0.2078,796.1666666666666,6.0,107.0,1.0,7.0,0.04715909,0.0,5.207100591715976,3,4

i always find myself buying her books i like the length and the cost i feel comfortable in her using the conflict about mating in each of her stories but i m so tired of the over use of all the snark and shrewishness it gets old the girls constantly snip at each other they are mean and smart alecks to their mates in every book the females take pride in smashing their heels into the males feet they especially love to take groin shots that really makes them gleeful there truly isn t anything to like about them the relationships have no kindness no friendliness no tenderness on the girls parts why would anyone want to even know them at one point one male in anger asks what did he do to deserve the misfortune of her as his mate and it hurts her feelings really i m sorry but there isn t any kind of true relationship between the mates except a physical one until the very last minutes it s all sex and fighting i would like to see the author try a slightly different formula soon where there will be some love and romance in the book anger and sarcasm and slap stick violence can only entertain for so long if everyone in the cast is unreasonable they just seem like idiots,3,1206.0,221.0,0.0,-0.0101,1311.3333333333333,3.0,,,0.0,0.016583748,3.0,5.457013574660634,3,2

historical novels with strong female leading characters are compelling to me so i thought i d give this one a chance the book started out well a woman with a mystery in her past makes friends in a new town starts a business and begins to have feelings for one of her employees then things went downhill i don t care for graphic sex scenes in the novels i read and there were several here but i could have forgiven them if they had been congruent with the characters however the scenes in this book were not major spoiler alert when a character has endured rape and then her first encounter with her former fianc eacute is incredibly rough sex followed by him storming off this is not only out of character but is downright abusive and sickening especially if she still moons about him and wonders if he will ever love her sick i started the book with a great sense of expectation and finished it with nausea and loathing skip this one unless the above scenario appeals to you,1,1005.0,175.0,0.0,0.0223,,,,,0.0,0.029850746,0.0,5.742857142857143,1,3

the pros and cons of rune pros good story concept quick read i finished it in less than an hour cons the writing is utterly simplistic and if it weren t for the constant use of offensive language it could ve been a great read for ten year olds the dialogue is awkward and feels forced overall rune doesn t offer anything new you haven t read before i ve enjoyed this author s adult horror novels but struggled to get into this story and connect with the underdeveloped characters not a read i ll recommend to my closest friends but if you re in the mood for an effortless quick read before bedtime this would definitely be it check out jh glaze s john hazzard novels and his other novellas which in my opinion are way better than this,3,828.0,121.0,0.0,0.1007,1444.5,4.0,,,0.0,0.024154589,0.0,6.8429752066115705,3,2

i am not sure where the other reviews came from for this title but do not believe them i went into earthwalker with certain expectations i read the reviews i liked the mini preview on the amazon page but this story is not what i expected it is awful quite frankly i am a little miffed that i spent cents on it before those who wrote reviews and loved it go crazy i will tell you why i dislike it so first the character of decklan while props for the cool name is awful not in the omg she is a raving loon but in the sense that i felt no compassion for her or her so called plight decklan is everything one would expect a female police officer to be tough smart and able to handle herself so why did i not like her simple in the midst of all her so called character traits listed above she is whinny i mean come on you have bad luck with men join the rest of us oh your mommy died again that is part of life and my daddy is mia and has a new family yikes i mean for all the time the auhtor spends telling the reader that decklan is tough and attractive and all that she spent little time actually showing us that she is all these things the climax happens and there is a glimpse but not enough to save the annoyance that is decklan holmes second the male characters and the story line are too predictable so much so that i pretty much knew what was going on early on the fact that decklan is a detective and she has no clue gives merit to what i was saying about the characterization of decklan by the author there is the typical bad boy and good boy and the pull towards the bad boy that decklan cannot seem to get past the minor characters are suppose to be influencial but i found them fillers used to patch up holes in the storyline third the storyline ug where to begin i am all in favor of fresh mythology revloving around parnormal and fantasy but if one is going to mix the generes they must think okay does this make sense the mythology here is frustrating and quite frankly bad i understood what the author wanted to do i just think too much of something is usually not the way to go this story jumps around angels demons and realms fearies and everywhere in between i found it confusing and uneccessary the story would have improved greatly had the author stuck to one thing make them all angels or demons hell even mermaids but do not hop from one to the next it does not make it better but makes it annoying overall i will not be back should anymore in this series be made i found i detested decklan and her behavior as well as the mythology surrounding her special ness i did not like the so called romance between the characters and thought a certain things a little strange branding rings rain really on a last note i take offense to the author s use of the nickname sherlock and watson i am quite sure that if sir doyle knew this he would be infuriated,1,2954.0,551.0,0.0,-0.0249,2221.5,4.0,,,1.0,0.023696683,4.0,5.361161524500908,1,2

i truly believe this book was written by an extremely ocd person hoping to trick people by using the words speed cleaning tho person talks about cleaning kid s bedrooms for days how not using zip ties causes them to spend hours sorting the wires in their living room the author probably cries when a family member puts groceries away and put an item in it s wrong alphabetical location at least some of the natural cleaning recipes were good an some tips were good but do not expect this book to help you save time cleaning the author literally says you need to think like a maid when you clean and face it maids spend all day every day cleaning because they get paid for it honestly for good cleaning tips that actually help you keep things clean and organized and save time i ll stick with flylady,1,818.0,144.0,0.0,0.2371,,,,,0.0,0.03178484,0.0,5.680555555555555,1,5

i was surprised that this short story turned out to be a loose take on cinderella it works out great though because it imaginatively intertwined the fairy tale with science fiction and the world of the doctor i enjoyed seeing how the author integrated the two that element of fairy tale magic was immediately and correctly dismissed by the doctor but unfortunately there was no explanation given for the science behind reanimating dead people and for the ending with princess ash it all seems very like magic and i m surprised that the doctor didn t discover what was the mechanism behind it this was the reason why i lowered the rating for this story because i really enjoyed it but i was left feeling very confused at the end in addition to fairy tales this story also incorporates a version of zombies which i thought was pretty interesting it s horrific and well described so i think that grounded this story in a good old fashioned who adventure as the doctor tries to understand and help the people in this world the other main characters were brief and mostly fulfilled predictable and stereotypical roles but it worked to keep the plot going and i felt interested enough in the characters to hope they succeeded the th doctor is captured well in this in all his charming and slightly eccentric ways and there are even a couple really funny moments in this story although it is all too brief this is a very enjoyable read that i would probably recommend even more strongly if only there were more of an explanation about how certain things happened in the plot i received this book from the publisher or author for a fair and honest review i was not compensated for this review,3,1725.0,300.0,0.0,0.1514,1887.0,2.0,1156.0,1.0,0.0,0.016811594,0.0,5.75,3,4

whew there is a lot going on in supernatural freak if you like paranormal adventure mysteries you are in the right place supernatural freak drops you right in the middle of action and the main character has to fend off a werewolf attack within the first of the book and it doesn t stop afterwards that is action packed robyn seemed like she was getting attacked left and right throughout the story she is a tough cookie though that s for sure she would not give up i admired that about her i also loved her sense of humor it was perfect to break of up some of the more action packed scenes along with robyn we meet her eclectic group of friends i really liked them too especially william my favorite thing about supernatural freak was the variety of paranormal supernatural creatures it kind of reminded me of paranormalcy by kiersten white in that regard i love it when a book is not a pure vampire or witch book if the world can incorporate a bunch of different creatures and have them make sense in the story that is a lot better in my opinion and louisa klein did a great job of not only including a bunch of different creatures but also giving them all their own little role or place in the world those details really added to the story the writing style was a little off for me at times i wasn t the biggest fan of the first person it was kind of jarring for me and i found myself getting confused early on in the story once the mysterious tree handed kid came into the story i found myself getting more interested and the first person didn t throw me off as much and now this is a small point but i caught myself thinking it a bunch of times while reading there are a lot of really long paragraphs some multiple pages long that i would have liked to seen broken up a bit more it was kind of hard on my eyes to read one huge block of works on the page i think supernatural freak would appeal to both guys and girl readers because the romance is not a big element in this story at all there is a little bit of romance but this is a paranormal book not a paranormal romance disclaimer i got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review i was not compensated for my review,3,2233.0,415.0,0.0,0.206,2243.0,2.0,,,2.0,0.021495746,0.0,5.380722891566265,3,4
ashley dawson is use to waking up to spirits but this certain spirit is different this spirit named sara manifests and wants ashley to visit a man named nathaniel marshall ashley is instantly drawn into the mystery that is surrounding this spirit and wants to help sara immediately she finds out that nathaniel was sara s husband and sara wants her to help nathaniel heal this is one hard job to do when nathaniel is not about to believe ashley s bizarre explanation nathaniel was devastated when his wife passed away and has never fully recovered now that a curvy vivacious woman has shown up on his doorstep saying that his dead wife has sent her to heal him nathaniel really thinks he has gone crazy but maybe what happened to his wife wasn t an accident and that is what sara is trying to say by bringing ashley into the picture the truth will come to light but at what price will nathaniel lose ashley too at the hands of someone hell bent on revenge the beginning is hauntingly good and continues its pace throughout whittier weaves characters from her previous book and continues the intense emotions all the way to the end i do have to say that the tidbit about her friend s boyfriend was predictable but i am thinking there might be another story coming out with those two e book was provided by author for an honest review,3,1349.0,235.0,0.0,0.1092,,,,,0.0,0.022979986,2.0,5.740425531914894,3,4
i know this is her first book and i commend her for the effort however i think she would be better off writing teen novels instead of adult romance i felt i was reading a story about an adolescent by an adolescent misty acted like a naive teenager instead of an almost year old woman the story has great potential and i would like to see it after the author matures in her writing enough to rework it but as it is i just cannot recommend it at the very least she needs a new editor how did so many grammatical errors make it through the editing process that in itself was distracting i m only glad it was a free kindle read i would hate to know i paid for it,1,683.0,130.0,1.0,0.1123,462.0,2.0,558.5,4.0,0.0,0.02489019,1.0,5.253846153846154,1,2

the hero in this story was really funny he had a great sense of humor which is missing in so many novels like this one it s refreshing to read about attractive men who aren t angry and out of touch with their feelings and desires however the disappointment of this story was the love the passionate encounters between the hero and heroine were short dull unromantic and forgettable the thing that sticks out in my mind was a short lame liaison on a kitchen floor not the kitchen counter not the kitchen table but the kitchen floor blech,3,557.0,96.0,0.0,-0.0057,373.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.014362657,0.0,5.802083333333333,3,1

i received an e copy of this book from the publishers at netgalley in exchange for an honest review as is customary for me i scoured netgalley for new reads and stumbled across this little gem i loved the cracked and creepy cover as well as the seemingly horrific synopsis i had my fingers crossed a lucky rabbit s foot clutched in my hand and a wish on a star that i would find this book to be everything the appearance made it out to be natalie s story begins with her determination to leave the safety of her adopted family to search out and destroy her abusive father that has thrust himself back into her life she has the limp and the scars to prove that her father is a very dangerous man and to protect the people that she loves she knows she must draw him away from them and kill him once and for all naturally things don t go as planned her father has no desire to wait until she is safely out of town before he comes after her it is this little problem that causes her to have to come clean to her best friend and adopted sister about her father and his odd obsession with her her sister decides that natalie cannot do this alone and she will help her rid her life of the fiend who haunts her dreams that is all that i managed to get into the book i am a firm believer in always finishing what you begin i swore to myself that i would never start a book and not finish it especially not if it was only something pages that is such a short read i should have been able to finish it despite not liking it unfortunately after nearly two weeks of only being able to read a page of two at a time i finally had to resign myself to having to write my first dnf did not finish review it is disheartening that something i hoped would be so wonderful turned out to not be able to draw me in in the slightest the book s writing was a little off kilter in the beginning i had no idea who was talking since it was in first person narrative i had no pronouns such as he or she to go off i had to go back to the synopsis to figure out whether the protagonist was a female or male that was my first issue the next was in natalie as a character natalie as a character has a lot of baggage naturally she seemed to always be the wounded victim and that may be possibly why i couldn t finish the book i like my characters to have a few scars but be able to power through it and come out the other side perhaps if i kept reading natalie would have rallied but after making it through and still not being able to continue without gritting my teeth i had to throw in the towel would i be willing to try out another of chris little s books perhaps but not very likely review posted on,1,2721.0,521.0,0.0,0.0763,3029.5,2.0,,,0.0,0.020580668,1.0,5.222648752399232,1,2

soul hunger is a book that suffers from a well known ailment first book syndrome the author clearly has a world that she wants to develop but unfortunately tries to do so all in the first chapter paragraph after paragraph of expository background the cast of characters is stereotyping we have the tough scary leader his straight talking right hand man the bookish historian and the lover that no one ever rejects and a couple of less developed others i guess in case the series needs expanding now i know what i m reading when i m looking at books like this as the blurb says mehen must protect mortals from the undead has never struggled with the task until he saves a woman from three undead and finds himself in need of saving i know i m not passing through the frosty upper echelons of high literature as a result my expectations were not that high overall it s not a bad story it s just not a good story the plot is roughly handled with some chapters reading as filler between random and pointless sex scenes the main female character is so bland she was almost irrelevant there are also the odd turns of phrase that an editor should have caught she had never seen a better looking man in person in her entire life that really is just clunky writing and then there s she regarded him with a small amount of fear lurking in her eyes an amount of something cannot lurk fear can lurk in her eyes sure but an amount the english language just doesn t work that way this is what a decent editor should have picked up on and polished with the author also a little more attention to word choice is necessary i m sure just being here with you will cause mehen to wale on me wale is a horizontal wooden strip for a boat according to the dictionary the right homophone is wail spelt just like the sound this isn t being picky if you re going to publish then you need to do it right add to that the clunky plot development and inability to handle the many characters in the story and you have a book that is a bit of a mess i imagine with practice and an editor who is more attentive this writer could improve overall it s readable and as such is worth it s price,1,2245.0,399.0,0.0,0.0596,1401.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.016035635,1.0,5.6265664160401005,1,3

there is a lot to love about this fast romp if you love nerd heros and heroines this is the book for you the leads meet on line in a video game and then plan to meet at a fantasy gaming convention in person the hero has a career he can t reveal and the heroine is coming off a bad break up with a fellow member of her game guild these parts of their characters were well developed the hero suffers from what i call beauty burden he is very good looking and he tends to attract much more conventional women than the type he likes which are smart feisty cute nerdy women he liked to let his nerd flag fly and loves to dress up in costume for cos costume play which is a common nerd fun at conventions this makes him a wonderful and interesting hero the writing here is good although jumpy in points of view and focus in places the scope of the book is very narrow we get very little secondary characters though i would like trevor a co worker of the hero to get his own story we also know very little about the characters backstories and families this was a fun witty book and with real sexy times and i look forward to more books by this writer this book was given to me for my honest review,3,1208.0,230.0,0.0,0.2328,614.8888888888889,18.0,,,0.0,0.015728477,0.0,5.252173913043478,3,4

i consider this more a short story rather than a novel and a good thing too because i did not enjoy reading it it has a cute premise however this book is a little dated and has no basis in reality in terms of what it s like to live in new york among the rich people don t send taxi s to pick a person up they send a car service if you re hurting for money you don t live on park avenue and if you were a debutante you generally don t need to work it would have been more interesting if there was more back story to why a former deb was now so poor she needed extra work to buy a kitten i liked the premise a lot but overall it was just a ridiculously written story with juvenile dialogue and absurd circumstances,1,736.0,143.0,0.0,0.1201,,,1116.0,2.0,0.0,0.016304348,0.0,5.146853146853147,1,2

i have enjoyed reading full length novels by julianne maclean and really expected this novella to be a pleasurable read not so much the writing seemed unusually clunky and the novella read like cliff notes to a book the author used a style that i detest in romance novels she had the characters mentally recite the story line like a year old to clue the reader in to what was happening rather than allowing the actions of the character to reveal the story to the reader if this were my first exposure to ms macleans writing it is unlikely i would ever read one of her full length novels,1,601.0,108.0,0.0,0.125,,,,,0.0,0.019966722,0.0,5.564814814814815,1,3

i read the reviews so i knew what to expect but i love mary calmes she s written some of my all time favorites so i went ahead and bought it anyway it has themes she often writes about in fact her books much as i love them are starting to blur there is always the too perfect narrator who underestimates his impact on those around him and the more aggressive love interest who needs some polishing i love these themes but here everything was too rushed and too odd it would have worked just as well or better without the supernatural element which felt grafted on and silly i liked julian quieter longing for connection refusing to sleep around but ryan felt like a pastiche just personality traits squished together without becoming a whole i rate it stars rounded up to because i finished it,3,844.0,148.0,0.0,0.3393,843.6923076923077,13.0,,,1.0,0.018957347,0.0,5.702702702702703,3,4
i didn t like the first in this series but i read the second to see what would happen i shouldn t have bothered this one is more gruesome and perverse than the first i didn t like any of the characters and the ending still left everything hanging i guess tomerlin is working on the third one now but i don t plan to read it the only character i slightly liked was killed off in book and i just don t care what happens to anyone the writing has merit but i ve never read a book so dark and seedy it s worse than any horror film there were only a few minor errors sync was used but it didn t come into our vocabulary until the s sent was used for scent for for far and kate clutched of the larger crates still the writing was good it was the content that i object to i know i ll get some no helpful votes for this review like i did one the first one and it hurt my score as a reviewer but i feel i must be honest i will not lie about how i feel about a book,1,1001.0,194.0,0.0,0.0625,2015.1,10.0,,,0.0,0.027972028,0.0,5.15979381443299,1,3

i purchased the paperback version really good book it has some pictures of the recipes which adds color to the book great recipes that meet all the required meals all day long list price really exciting most books on a diet of such size and usually without pictures cost a lot more than really important to me that the writer chose to write in big letters it really helps me to read the recipes when i prepare food in the kitchen,3,450.0,85.0,0.0,0.2818,,,,,0.0,0.015555556,0.0,5.294117647058823,3,5
